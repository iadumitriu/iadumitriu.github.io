<p> DiPP members combine Harrisâ€™s quantitative education with a specific interest in data-based policy. We help members learn about opportunities to use their data and policy skills outside the classroom.  We organize networking events with the Chicago data community and are always interested in opportunities for our members to show off their data skills. </p>

<p>If you want to get the word out to DiPP members about a data-related opportunity or participate in a networking event, contact <a href="mailto:ssajewski@uchicago.edu?subject=DiPPcareers">Sarah Sajewski</a>.</p>
