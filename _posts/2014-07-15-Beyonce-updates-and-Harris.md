(1) Via Adriana, a mesmerizing data visualization of a random NYC taxicab's day: <http://nyctaxi.herokuapp.com/> The underlying data was FOIL'd (NY state version of FOIA) and is here: <http://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/> 

(2) You all apparently love shortcuts. So in the interest of being service-y, Jonathan will dish out more of what you love tomorrow at Hack Harris. If there's interest, he will also dive into git and get everyone set up on github and we'll talk about using the terminal.

(3) Here's a secret. All the cool kids refer to Hack Harris as HaHa. If you want to be a cool kid, I suggest that you begin doing the same.

Thanks,
Lara and Jonathan
