Remember that Hack Harris will be moving to Harris starting tomorrow. We'll be in room 140C this week, with a start time of 6pm. This should give all you working folk time to get down to Hyde Park from your real person jobs, easing the transition to becoming a student again. 

This week we'll cover mapping in CartoDB. We'll have three or four data sets picked out from the City of Chicago's open data portal for you all to play with, hopefully in small groups. 

If you know any incoming students — or even if you just see one standing scared in the cafe of Harris, confused and unsure about how to find, well, basically anything in that building — point them to Hack Harris.
