Is the air a bit lighter, is gravity working a little harder, today or is it just me? Who knows, but the best way to deal with summer's halfway point and the existential dread that comes with it is to be productive at this week's Hack Harris! Come learn more Python, and if you're lucky maybe you'll be there when Sarah coins a new data-related pun :)

Optional things to do before Wednesday:
* [Install IPython Notebook] (http://ipython.org/install.html)
* [Check out some beginner tutorials] (https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)
