Have you heard this new buzzword "collaboration"? What does it mean? And what is "version control"? Is that like when I save my document under a different name every time I make an edit? And THEN does your computer always crash when using tracked changes in Word? I know mine does. Then I have to go back to version 1 and start over. *(That's why I pasted a picture of a cute rabbit into version 1, to give me the strength to keep going.)*

Some people are talking about a website that lets you work on documents with others without worrying about version control -- even work AT THE SAME TIME. And you always have old versions of all files so you can't accidentally overwrite last year's budget. It's also rumored to give +100,000 hacker points. *Can this be real?*

Also, why doesn't Hack Harris have a website? Can we fix this? Together?

Bring your laptops. See you Wednesday!

Yours in collaboration,
