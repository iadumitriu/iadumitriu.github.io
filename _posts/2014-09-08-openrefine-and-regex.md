This week at Hack Harris (Wednesday at 6pm in 140B) we'll be starting with an intro to [OpenRefine](https://xmail.uchicago.edu/owa/redir.aspx?C=RNF7qgZ4_0eFQe-yUrUS1Y4QRH_pn9EI8SoFycB__xOo-DajSNt9rzLvQRIMlQCjJni1v4xewUQ.&URL=http%3a%2f%2fopenrefine.org%2f), previously Google Refine. If you could [download](https://xmail.uchicago.edu/owa/redir.aspx?C=RNF7qgZ4_0eFQe-yUrUS1Y4QRH_pn9EI8SoFycB__xOo-DajSNt9rzLvQRIMlQCjJni1v4xewUQ.&URL=http%3a%2f%2fopenrefine.org%2fdownload.html) and install it before Wednesday, that'd be swell but not mandatory. OpenRefine is a hybrid database and spreadsheet, borrowing parts of each to make tedious data cleaning of big data sets still tedious but slightly less annoying. 

We'll also be exploring the marvelous world of regular expressions, a widespread tool for searching text that can be used in practically any language, as well as in OpenRefine. Inspired by [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/1313/), we'll take a look at a great [tutorial](http://www.regular-expressions.info/dot.html) and then play a few rounds of [Regex Golf](https://regex.alf.nu/).
