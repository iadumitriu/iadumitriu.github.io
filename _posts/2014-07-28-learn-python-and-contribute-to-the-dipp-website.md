Hello lovelies, 

(1) This week's HaHa* is one not to be missed. If Jonathan's and my presence isn't enough of a draw, we'll also be teaching you intro data exploration in Python! We'll grab a few exercises from this book: <http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/thinkstats.pdf>.

To sum: Learn Python at HaHa, Wed. @ 6pm, Argo Tea at 16 W. Randolph 

(2) DiPP has a website! [Check us out](http://uc-dipp.github.io/) â€” aren't we looking pretty? +1,000 to last week's HaHa attendees for getting it off the ground. 

Jonathan and I may write your snarky weekly HaHa updates, but all of YOU are DiPP. So show your DiPP love and devotion by helping to build the website. It's built with Jekyll and Poole on GitHub: <https://github.com/uc-dipp/uc-dipp.github.io>

If that means nothing to you, fear not. Just sign up for a free GitHub account, shoot me or Jonathan your username, and we'll add you to the project and give you some pointers on how to get started. If you can Google "how to change font colors in HTML," you can contribute.

(3) DiPP has a Twitter: <http://twitter.com/uchicagodipp> Recently this thing called "my paying job" has gotten in the way of maintaining it as well I'd like, so please send me links! 

(4) If you've read this far, thanks so much. As your reward, here's a cute animal curated personally for you by the greatest cute-animals-on-the-Internet curator of all, Adriana Ciccone: <http://i.imgur.com/mC2nvAH.jpg>

Thanks and see you Wednesday,

Jonathan and Lara

\* For those who don't read all their emails super closely, HaHa is the accepted alternative name for Hack Harris. All thanks go to Sarah Sajewski for the coining.
