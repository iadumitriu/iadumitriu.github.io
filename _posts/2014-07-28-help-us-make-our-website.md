All of YOU are DiPP. So show your DiPP love and devotion by helping to build the website. It's built with Jekyll and Poole on [GitHub](https://github.com/uc-dipp/uc-dipp.github.io).

If that means nothing to you, fear not. Just [sign up for a free GitHub account](http://github.com), [shoot us your username](mailto:hackharris14@gmail.com), and we'll add you to the project and give you some pointers on how to get started. If you can Google "how to change font colors in HTML," you can contribute.
