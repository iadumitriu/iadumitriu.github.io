If you don't want to think about how summer is ending, ignore this post. But if you like putting things on your calendar weeks in advance, make sure to note the Hack Harris beginning of the school year potluck. 

It'll be on Wednesday (duh), 9/24 in Hyde Park at 6pm. We'll remind you again in a few weeks. This will be during orientation week and incoming students are invited. Alums, if you dare to return to Hyde Park, we'd very much welcome your beautiful faces, too!
