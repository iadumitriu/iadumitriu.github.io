### Downloading R
- R can be installed from [here](http://www.r-project.org/)
- RStudio, a really nice “front-end” for programming in R can downloaded from [here](http://www.rstudio.com/) (If you’re looking to use RStudio, you still need to have base R installed)

### Interactive websites (free)
- [Code School](http://tryr.codeschool.com/)
- [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-r)

### Books (like paper ones)
- Bob Muenchen’s books: [R for Stata Users](http://www.amazon.com/R-Stata-Users-Statistics-Computing/dp/1461425964), and [R for SAS and SPSS Users](http://www.amazon.com/SAS-SPSS-Users-Statistics-Computing/dp/1461406846/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1394593271&sr=1-1&keywords=r+for+sas+and+spss+users)
    - Also see his [website for the books](http://r4stats.com/), where there are freely downloadable and *very* succinct and helpful code snippet translations
    - E.g., in the [downloads for the Stata book](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4mP5kf41BrmM0hncl9xSDV4M2s/edit), there are files **merge.do** and **merge.r**, which have the many ways to set up a merge in each program’s syntax

## Python
<img src="/resources/python.jpg" align="right" />
### Downloading Python
- If you have a Mac, Python comes on your computer. Open Terminal and type in <code>python</code>. 
- You can also install Python with an IDLE (a prettier environment for working in the language) [here](https://www.python.org/download/).
- You can use either version 2.7.x or version 3.x. However, be aware that some older code may not work in version 3.x, and some newer features will not be available in version 2.7.x. Many developers have *both* versions on their computers. 

### Interactive websites (free)

## JavaScript
### What is JavaScript?
- Make web pages interactive. 
- Truly cross-platform (works in same browser across all operating systems), interpreted by your browser.
- Events happen, JS reacts (e.g. click, hover).

### Cool, I wrote some JS, where do I put it? 
- In `<script>` tags in your HTML, after `</body>`.

### Where can I learn JS?
- <http://www.w3schools.com/js/>
- [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript)

## Where can I practice JS? 
- <http://jsfiddle.net/>

## An intro to JS syntax:
- Comment with `//` at beginning of line or `/*` and `*/`
- End all executable lines with `;` 
- Variables can hold lots of different things; declare with `var`
    - Dynamic, meaning you can change what kind of thing they hold halfway through a program
    - Scope: vars declared within a function are local; vars declared outside of a function are global; vars given to a function as parameters are local
- Declare a function with `function()`
    - Spit out something with `return` keyword
- Object with attributes:
    - `var backpack = {color:”blue flowers”, weight:30, contents:”books”}`
- Arrays can hold objects, variables, functions, other arrays. Wow!

## What else can you do with JS?
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com) library lets you easily move around and change elements on the page
